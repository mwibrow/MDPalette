# ðŸŽ¨ MDPallete

*MDPallete* contains
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/)
compatible palettes for
the [Material Design colors](https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-color-palette).
Three palettes are provided,
the primary and secondary palettes
separately (`md-primary.gpl` and
`md-secondary.gpl`, respectively),
and all the colors in one file
(`md.gpl`).
Use whichever is most suitable,
or even one of the alternative material
design palettes such as the one provided by
[KiSSFLOW](https://github.com/KiSSFLOW/gimp-material-design-color-palette) or
[drac](https://github.com/drac/Material-Design-Color-Palette-for-Inkscape). Too much choice is never a bad thing.


## Usage

- GIMP:
use the [_Import Palette dialog_](https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-palette-dialog.html#gimp-palette-import).
- Inkscape:
copy the palette file to a location where Inkscape can
see it and restart. This location is platform specific,
but on Linux it usually is some variation on
`$HOME/.config/inkscape/palettes/`.
